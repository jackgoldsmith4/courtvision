Game Recap
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Anthony Edwards celebrated a milestone Sunday by scoring 37 points and leading the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 129-120 victory over the Indiana Pacers.
Edwards became the fourth-youngest player in NBA history to reach the 2,500-point mark when he made his first basket of the game. The second-year forward is 20 years, 192 days old. LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker are the only younger players to achieve the feat.
The Timberwolves snapped a two-game losing streak overall and a three-game losing streak at Indiana as they compete to finish among the top six in the Western Conference and avoid the play-in round.
Edwards made seven 3-pointers and had five rebounds, four assists and four steals on a day Karl Anthony-Towns was in foul trouble.
''When he's playing that well, we're a tough team,'' guard Patrick Beverley said, referring to Edwards. ''I love the way he played tonight, put the pressure on them all night. He's hard to guard and it can be anybody's night.''
Oshae Brissett had a season-high 22 points and matched his career high with 13 rebounds for Indiana, which has lost six in a row.. Tyrese Haliburton added 22 points and 16 assists, one short of tying his career high in just his second game with the Pacers.
The difference was Minnesota's size and depth.
''Against a team that had all their guys and is playing very well and is very talented we did some good things to hang around and give ourselves a chance in the fourth,'' Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. ''There's some very positive things and some things that obviously need work. We're just running low on bodies now.''
Indiana opened with a quick scoring flurry, but the Timberwolves cut the deficit to 37-33 at the end of one quarter then took charge in the second. Malik Beasley's 3-pointer gave the Timberwolves the lead and spurred a 13-0 run that allowed the Timberwolves to build a 56-44 lead.
They extended the margin to 18 early in the second half - before the Pacers finally charged back. Indiana closed to 96-94 in the final minute of the third quarter and made it a two-point game again when Terry Taylor opened the fourth by making two free throws. But Minnesota answered with an 8-2 run.
