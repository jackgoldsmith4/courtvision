Game Recap
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) Damian Lillard scored 32 points, Norman Powell added 28 and the Portland Trail Blazers beat Memphis 105-100 on Sunday night to snap the Grizzlies' five-game winning streak.
Dillon Brooks scored a career-high 37 points for Memphis. The Grizzlies lost for the second time in their last 12 games.
''It's not like we blew them out,'' Lillard said. ''We had to execute. We had to get stops. We had to weather a few storms. It was a great win.''
Powell scored 20 in the second half to give the Trail Blazers their second straight victory after they snapped a seven-game losing streak with a home victory over Charlotte on Friday night.
Portland took the lead, 94-91, on a four-point play by Lillard with 4:02 left and reclaimed the advantage, 97-95, on a 3-pointer by Powell three minutes later.
''It was a big play,'' Powell said about his 3-pointer. ''I was just trying to find an opening. We are not going to get too excited, but it's a great win for us. It was great to get a gritty win.''
The Grizzlies had a chance to tie at 103 with 5.3 seconds to go, but Desmond Bane's 3-pointer rimmed out. Nassir Little added two free throws with 1.8 seconds left to seal the win.
''Pulling a game out like this shows growth,'' Lillard said.
Lillard scored 17 points of his 21 first-half points in the first quarter.
