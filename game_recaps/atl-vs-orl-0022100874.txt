Game Recap
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) All-Star starter Trae Young had 22 points and six assists and the Atlanta Hawks routed the Orlando Magic 130-109 on Wednesday night in the final game before the break for both teams.
Young played only 25 minutes after scoring 41 points in Atlanta's home victory over Cleveland on Tuesday night. The Hawks made 18 of 32 3-point shots and shot 50% overall.
''Anytime you can get some more rest in this league it's great because you play so many games,'' Young said. ''It was great that we were able to finish the game in three quarters, or three and a half quarters. Our bench was great tonight.''
Bogan Bogdanovic led Atlanta with 23 points.
Cole Anthony led Orlando with 23 points and seven rebounds. Rookie Jalen Suggs added 19 points in the Magic's fourth straight loss.
''Credit them for finding shooters and making shots,'' Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. ''Trae does such a great job of forcing all the attention on him, and then getting it to guys to make shots. We've obviously got to get better at defending the 3-point line.''
Young's 3-pointer with 6:26 left in the first quarter broke a 15-15 tie and started a 13-2 run that put the Hawks up for good.
The back-to-back wins gave the Hawks (28-30) a boost before a week-long break.
''We understand exactly where we are and what we need to do,'' coach Nate McMillan said. ''We're still in the race but we have to be better to finish the season and play ourselves into it.''
Atlanta led 72-53 after shooting 13-for-19 from behind the arc in the first half. Young and Bogdanovic each made their first three 3-point attempts.
''I thought our guys had good focus,'' McMillan said. ''They didn't start this break before the game. We pretty much controlled the game from start to finish.''
