Game Recap
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) Aron Baynes isn't worried about style points from 3-point range.
The Australian center converted a career-best four 3-pointers Saturday night, leading to 20 points and the Phoenix Suns used a third quarter burst to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-105.
Baynes' last 3-pointer came from a familiar spot around the top of the key and caromed in from straight away. He didn't really say whether he called bank.
''I could have made a better play, but at the end of the day, happy it went down,'' the 6-foot-10 center said, adding: ''Better to learn in victory than it is in defeat, though. We'll take it.''
Devin Booker had 21 points to help the Suns improve to 4-2. He and Baynes combined to go 14 of 23 from the field and 7 of 10 from 3-point range, with Booker converting all three of his 3-point attempts. The Suns finished the night shooting 50%, including 14 of 34 from distance.
Rookie Ja Morant led Memphis with 24 points and seven assists. Dillon Brooks and Brandon Clarke scored 16 points each, Clarke adding 11 rebounds.
As it has through much of the early season, the game would get away from Memphis in the third quarter, part of the ongoing second-half problems for the young Grizzlies. Memphis has held halftime leads in all but one game this season, but have stumbled in the final two frames.
This time, Phoenix outscored Memphis 37-22 in the third, with the Grizzlies committing 11 turnovers. That helped the Suns to convert a two-point halftime deficit into a lead that reached 14 as Phoenix carried an 82-69 lead into the fourth quarter.
''We came in (before) the third quarter and talked about the adversity we've faced this season, and how we need to stick together through it all,'' Booker said about the second-half change. ''Went out there, kept moving the ball. Started out very good in the third quarter and it just continued the rest of the game.''
The second-half struggles are part of the growing pains for Memphis as it tries to make its way through a rebuilding phase around Morant and second-year forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who left the game in the third quarter with a right knee injury.
''Up (at) halftime, we've faced this before where teams pick up their energy,'' Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ''I didn't feel our energy was there in the third quarter.''
