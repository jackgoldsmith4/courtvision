Game Recap
DALLAS (AP) Nemanja Bjelica could see another game slipping away from the Sacramento Kings with the ball in Luka Doncic’s hands.
But Doncic missed a tying attempt in the final seconds as the Kings withstood a furious rally and beat the Mavericks 110-106 on Sunday night.
With the memory of an overtime loss at San Antonio on Friday fresh in his mind, Bjelica matched his career best with 30 points.
Richaun Holmes rebounded Doncic’s attempt to tie the game with eight seconds left. Doncic had taken Sacramento’s Cory Joseph down the lane for the turnaround shot that clanged off the front of the rim. After the rebound, the Kings called a timeout. Bogdan Bogdanovic in-bounded to Bjelica for a layup that sealed the win.
“We all see how great Luka is,” Holmes said, “so you just try to do as much as you can to take him out his comfort zone.”
Sacramento ended a three-game losing streak. Dallas had won five straight and 10 of 11 before the loss.
“It feels good to win,” Bjelica said. “After we lost (Friday) against San Antonio, it’s a very important win for us.”
Buddy Hield scored 26 points, including five 3-pointers, for Sacramento. Former Maverick Harrison Barnes had 13, Holmes added 12 and a game-high nine rebounds. Bogdanovic and Trevor Ariza scored 10 each.
“(Bjelica’s) got the skill, the passing ability and shooting ability to really put pressure on the defense,” Kings coach Luke Walton said. “We’re constantly encouraging him to be more aggressive and tonight he was aggressive.”
The Mavericks’ high scorer was Tim Hardaway Jr. with 29 points. He kept the Mavs in the game by making a career-high nine of 12 3-pointers.
Doncic finished with 27 points, including 17 in the second half after Sacramento had sprinted to a 66-46 lead.
“We were very disappointed at our defense in the first half, and the second half was certainly way better,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. “But, gotta play the whole game. A disappointing loss.”
Hardaway said there was a message at halftime.
“Do you guys want to get smacked at home or do you want to get the crowd involved and give yourself a chance to win and keep this thing going? Everybody took it to heart and did just that,” Hardaway said.
For Dallas, Dorian Finney-Smith and Kristaps Porzingis each had 13 points.
Sacramento didn’t trail in the game and led by as many as 24 points.
The lead was 106-90 with 6:34 remaining. A 10-0 run capped by a 3-pointer by Doncic pulled the Mavericks within six points. The Kings’ lead dwindled to two points on a fadeaway by Porzingis with 34 seconds left.
Barnes missed a shot in the lane. Finney-Smith grabbed the rebound with 14 seconds left. After a timeout, Doncic got the ball.
“He’s in the paint with a small defender on him,” Hardaway said. “I’ll take my chances with him all day long.”
