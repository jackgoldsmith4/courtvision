Game Recap
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) Damian Lillard scored 36 points and the Portland Trail Blazers extended their winning streak over the Orlando Magic to eight games with a 106-97 victory on Tuesday night.
Carmelo Anthony added a season-high 23 points, including five 3-pointers. It was Lillard's 13th game with 30-plus points this season.
Nikola Vucevic had 27 points and 15 rebounds for the short-handed Magic, who have lost six of their last seven games. Rookie Cole Anthony started but did not return for the second half because of a shoulder injury.
Carmelo Anthony hit a 3-pointer that gave the Blazers a 93-79 lead early in the fourth quarter and Portland didn't let the Magic get within single digits until the final seconds.
Evan Fournier, a late scratch on Saturday with back spasms when Orlando fell 118-92 at home to the Bulls, was unavailable again against Portland. The Magic were also without Michael Carter-Williams, who has a sprained foot, and Aaron Gordon because of a sprained left ankle.
But the Magic got some good news with the return of Al-Farouq Aminu, who played for the first time this season after rehabbing his right knee, although he was limited to just five minutes in the opening half. Aminu played for four years in Portland before signing with Orlando as a free agent in 2019.
Portland led by as many as 16 points in the opening quarter. Gary Trent Jr.'s 3-pointer put the Blazers up 45-28 midway through the second.
Orlando's 10-3 run to close out the half cut the margin to 50-43. Anthony appeared to hurt his right shoulder late in the second quarter and did not return. Frank Mason started the second half.
The Magic pulled to 70-63 on Terrence Ross' floater. The Blazers answered with an 8-0 run to pull away and led 84-73 going into the final period.
