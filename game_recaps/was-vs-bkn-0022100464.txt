NEW YORK (AP) Rui Hachimura scored 20 points, Corey Kispert added 16 and the Washington Wizards beat the Brooklyn Nets 117-103 on Thursday night.
Ish Smith had 15 points, and Dani Avdija 13 to help the Wizards win their second straight.
''It was a big win. We needed this one,'' Hachimura said. ''Last night we lost a tough game and we came back with a good energy especially at their home.''
The Wizards improved to 27-31 and moved a game behind Charlotte and Atlanta for a play-in spot with 24 games remaining in the regular season.
Patty Mills scored 22 points, and Cam Thomas added 20 for the Nets, coming off a comeback victory at New York on Wednesday night. They have lost 12 of 14.
''We're excited. We have 22 games to come together as a team,'' Nets coach Steve Nash said. ''Hopefully, we have a good run of health where we can really build something in a short period of time and get a better seed and also more cohesions going into the playoffs.''
The Nets fell behind by 13 points early in the third quarter and got consecutive 3-pointers from Cam Thomas and Jevon Carter to take a 76-73 lead with 1:36 left in the period.
Smith and Kispert combined for seven straight points to extend Washington's lead to 95-83 with under eight minutes to play in the fourth quarter before the Nets mounted a second comeback.

TIP INS
Wizards: Anthony Gill added 12 points and made both of his 3-point attempts in 19 minutes of play.
Nets: Nash is not quite sure whether Joe Harris will step back on the court following the All-Star break. ''It's possible but couldn't say for sure though right now,'' the Brooklyn coach said prior to the game. Harris has been sidelined since Nov. 14 when he injured his left ankle and had arthroscopic surgery Nov. 29. . Mills made five 3s to move into fourth place for most 3-pointers made in a single-season with 186. He surpassed Harris, who had 183 from long distance during the 2018-19 season.
